Databases:

This project requires the use of MongoDB to operate correctly. It will need the database
"userDB" to be created in the MongoDB shell. Within this database, there exist the collections 
"reports", "buyers", "admins", "sellers", and "listings". These will be the reports for admins
to look over, the buyers, admins, and sellers in the database, and the listings in the store,
respectively. 

Ports:

This server is to be run on local port 8080
