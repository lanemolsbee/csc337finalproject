Databases:

This project requires the use of MongoDB to operate correctly. It will need the database
"userDB" to be created in the MongoDB shell. Within this database, there exist the collections 
"reports", "buyers", "admins", "sellers", and "listings". These will be the reports for admins
to look over, the buyers, admins, and sellers in the database, and the listings in the store,
respectively. 

Ports:

This server is to be run on local port 8080

Modules:

Buyer: buyers can view the contents of the store and log out.

Seller: Sellers can upload books to the store. 

Admin: Admins can view reports that sellers and buyers have submitted. 

Home Pages:

This is where users can login. They can view the home page, the about page, the login page,
and the form submission page. 

Functions:

Functions for the most part are run asynchronously.
